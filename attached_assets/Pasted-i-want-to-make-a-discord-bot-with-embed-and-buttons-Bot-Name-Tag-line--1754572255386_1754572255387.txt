i want to make a discord bot  with embed and buttons 

Bot Name: ᴠᴀᴀᴢʜᴀ

Tag line: "𝓨𝓸𝓾𝓻 𝓯𝓻𝓲𝓮𝓷𝓭𝓵𝔂 𝓼𝓮𝓻𝓿𝓮𝓻 𝓪𝓼𝓼𝓲𝓼𝓽𝓪𝓷𝓽 𝓯𝓻𝓸𝓶 𝓖𝓸𝓭’𝓼 𝓞𝔀𝓷 𝓒𝓸𝓾𝓷𝓽𝓻𝔂 🌴"

Use occasional Malayalam phrases use in /help and any other places accordingly 

"**Namaskaram! Need help?**"

"**ᴠᴀᴀᴢʜᴀ-ʙᴏᴛ undu. Chill aanu!**"

* use buttons every where it need if i forget to mention

this bot will be used in many servers so make like that Use MONGO_URI as your bot’s long-term memory.

I will update MONGO_URI in screct code with MONGO_URI for bot memory 

Without it, bot will forget:

Moderator roles

XP and levels

Ticket states

Welcome/log channels

Reaction role settings

Anything server-specific


With it, bot remembers everything, for every server, even after:

Restart

Crash

Deployment

Hosting change
