## Environment Variables Required

- `BOT_OWNER_ID` - Discord user ID of bot owner (for clickable mentions)

## Running the Bot
The workflow "RXT ENGINE Bot" runs: `python main.py`

Expected startup sequence:
```
✅ Profile cards system loaded
✅ Global logging system loaded
✅ Server list monitoring system loaded
⚡ RXT ENGINE is starting...
```

If no token is configured, will show: `❌ Invalid bot token!` (this is normal)

## Database
- MongoDB database name: `rxt_engine_bot` (changed from vaazha_bot)
- Collections: servers, users, tickets, logs, reactions, warnings

## Features
### Active Systems

### Removed Features

## Architecture Decisions
- Centralized branding via brand_config.py to avoid scattered constants
- PIL image generation uses BrandColorsRGB for compatibility
- Clickable owner mentions using BOT_OWNER_ID environment variable
- Professional modern theme replacing cultural/regional branding
